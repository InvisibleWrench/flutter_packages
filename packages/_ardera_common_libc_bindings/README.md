# _ardera_common_libc_bindings

Some common C bindings (open, read, ioctl, and so on, GPIO, serial and SPI structs)

This package is not stable. I only published it because there's no way
to make [flutter_gpiod](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gpiod), [linux_serial](https://pub.dev/packages/linux_serial) and [linux_spidev](https://pub.dev/packages/linux_spidev)
depend on it without publishing to pub.dev.

I don't provide any support at all for any bugs, issues, feature requests, etc.
